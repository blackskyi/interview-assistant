You'll see your spoken question displayed exactly as transcribed:
```
Your Question:
Tell me about yourself
```

### Generated Answer
The AI will provide a context-aware answer that:
- References your resume details
- Aligns with the job description
- Uses the STAR method for behavioral questions
- Is conversational (30-90 seconds when spoken)
- Sounds natural and authentic

### Context Indicators
The answer will show which context was used:
- âœ“ Resume data
- âœ“ Job description

## Testing Tips

### For Best Voice Recognition:
1. **Speak clearly** at normal pace
2. **Reduce background noise**
3. **Use a good microphone** (laptop mic usually works)
4. **Wait 1-2 seconds** after asking before stopping

### For Best Answers:
1. **Upload a detailed resume** with skills and experiences
2. **Add a comprehensive job description**
3. **Ask complete questions** (not fragments)
4. **Try different question types** to see varied responses

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Microphone Not Working
**Problem:** "Failed to access microphone"
**Solution:**
- Check browser permissions (should show popup)
- Make sure you're using localhost or HTTPS
- Try Chrome/Firefox/Safari
- Restart browser if needed

### API Errors
**Problem:** "Failed to transcribe audio" or "Failed to generate answer"
**Solution:**
- Verify API keys in `backend/.env`
- Check API key quotas:
  - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/usage
  - Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/
- Ensure billing is set up if required
- Check backend console for detailed errors

### Recording Too Short
**Problem:** "Recording too short"
**Solution:**
- Speak for at least 2-3 seconds
- Make sure microphone is capturing audio
- Check system audio settings

### Poor Transcription Quality
**Problem:** Wrong words transcribed
**Solution:**
- Speak more clearly
- Reduce background noise
- Get closer to microphone
- Try speaking slower

## Architecture Overview

### Request Flow:

```
1. User clicks record â†’ Browser captures audio
2. User stops â†’ Audio blob created
3. Frontend sends audio â†’ Backend receives
4. Backend â†’ OpenAI Whisper API (transcription)
5. Backend â†’ Claude API (answer generation with context)
6. Backend â†’ Frontend (returns answer)
7. Frontend displays answer
```

### Session Management:

```
Upload Resume â†’ Session ID created
              â†“
Add Job Description â†’ Context stored
              â†“
Ask Questions â†’ Context retrieved for each answer
```

## Sample Demo Script

**"Let me show you the Interview Assistant in action:"**

1. **"First, I'll upload my resume..."** (Upload PDF)
   - "The system extracts my skills, experience, and education"

2. **"Next, I'll add the job description..."** (Paste job details)
   - "This helps tailor answers to the specific role"

3. **"Now I'll ask a question using my voice..."** (Click mic)
   - "Tell me about yourself" (Speak clearly)
   - (Stop recording)

4. **"Watch the system work:"**

   - "Then, Claude generates a personalized answer using my resume and job context"
   - "The answer is conversational and uses the STAR method"

5. **"Let me try another question..."**
   - "Tell me about a challenging project you worked on"
   - (Show how answer references specific resume details)

## Performance Metrics

**Typical Response Times:**
- Resume parsing: 1-3 seconds
- Speech transcription: 2-5 seconds
- Answer generation: 3-7 seconds
- **Total time per question: 5-12 seconds**

**API Costs (approximate):**
- Whisper transcription: ~$0.006 per minute

- **Cost per question: ~$0.02-0.05**

## Next Steps After Demo

1. **Try with your own resume and job posting**
2. **Practice common interview questions**
3. **Refine answers by regenerating with slight question variations**
4. **Read answers aloud to practice delivery**
5. **Customize wording to match your speaking style**
